      "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n",
      "Many jurisdictions are focused on achieving very low or net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by \n",
      "mid-century, bringing a spotlight to the biggest challenges in decarbonization. The transportation sector \n",
      "is responsible for about one-quarter of global GHG emissions and emissions are growing, even in the \n",
      "developed world where other emissions are generally flat. Liquid fuels made from oil dominate the sector; \n",
      "they are easy to transport and store, contain a great deal of energy for their weight and volume, and enable \n",
      "use of internal combustion engines. The degree of difficulty in decarbonizing transport varies across the \n",
      "sector. Electrification is relatively easy for smaller vehicles that travel shorter distances carrying lighter \n",
      "loads. For these vehicles, the added weight of a battery is less of a hindrance and the inherently simpler \n",
      "and more efficient electric motor and drivetrain (the system that delivers power from the motor to the \n",
      "wheels) make up for some of the weight penalty. However, the heavier forms of transportation are among \n",
      "the fastest growing, meaning that we must consider solutions for these more difficult vehicles as well. The \n",
      "challenge of decarbonizing these sectors and the technologies to overcome these challenges are global, \n",
      "but this paper focuses on policy options in the United States.\n",
      "Medium and heavy trucking and other forms of heavy ground transportation represent a middle \n",
      "ground in the decarbonization challenge. Vehicles that travel set routes in limited areas represent the \n",
      "low-hanging fruit for electrification. City buses, urban delivery vehicles, and equipment at ports can be \n",
      "recharged at a central location or at wireless pads along the way, and these vehicles are leading the \n",
      "way in heavy vehicle decarbonization. Longer distances and heavier loads bring additional challenges, \n",
      "especially the weight of the battery and the very high power needs for fast charging. Chargers rated \n",
      "as high as 3 megawatts are under development to charge tractor-trailers and West Coast utilities are \n",
      "looking at building charging stations with a maximum load of 23.5 megawatts. Such heavy loads for \n",
      "vehicle charging will require grid upgrades, especially in rural areas.\n",
      "Aviation and maritime shipping share important characteristics, despite being the most and least GHG-\n",
      "intensive forms of transport, respectively. These modes carry heavy loads with little or no opportunity for \n",
      "frequent refueling, except for short shuttle flights for airliners or ferries for maritime transport. The energy \n",
      "density of oil-based fuels is particularly important in these sectors. Low carbon fuels that can be dropped \n",
      "into the current fuel mix are likely to be important in decarbonizing both sectors, allowing progress despite \n",
      "25- to 30-year lifespans of airliners and container ships. In aviation, efficiency is already reducing per-mile \n",
      "emissions; new planes are as much as 25% more efficient than older models and more improvements are \n",
      "expected. Biomass-derived jet fuel is available today, but the supply of waste oil feedstock is not sufficient \n",
      "to meet demand. Biofuels from cellulosic crops and agricultural wastes are possibilities for the future, as 2DECARBONIZATION GOALS GET SERIOUS\n",
      "In October 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on \n",
      "Climate Change (IPCC) issued a warning that the \n",

      "emissions by 45% by around 2030 and reach net-\n",
      "zero emissions by 2050 to avert the worst impacts \n",
      "of climate change.1 However, meeting these goals \n",

      "enacted long-term emissions reductions goals. \n",
      "California3 and Hawaii4 are targeting net-zero \n",
      "emissions by 2045, while New York5 aims to reach \n",
      "that goal by 2050. Colorado has a goal to achieve \n",
      "90% reductions by 2050,6 with Maine7 and New \n",
      "Jersey8 seeking 80% reductions by mid-century.\n",
      "Nonetheless, emissions continue apace. May 2020 \n",
      "saw the highest concentration of carbon dioxide \n",
      "ever recorded at the Mauna Loa Observatory,9 \n",
      "where emissions have been monitored since 1959, \n",
      "despite recent short-term emissions reductions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, as states \n",
      "across the nation and the globe have reopened \n",
      "their economies, emissions have begun to increase \n",
      "rapidly.10 \n",
      "Most discussion about reducing emissions focuses \n",
      "on the power sector, and for good reason. Costs for \n",
      "renewable electricity generation have plummeted \n",
      "in recent years and emissions reductions in the \n",
      "power sector are generally easiest and cheapest. \n",

      "in January 2020. Bio- and waste-based fuels are also longer-term options in shipping, similar to aviation.\n",

      "example, some advanced biofuel technologies produce a range of fuels, similar to making a range of \n",

      "Technology exists to decarbonize the heavy transport sector, although many advanced technologies \n",
      "are expensive and not proven at scale. The challenge for policymakers will be keeping technology \n",
      "advances and policy in alignment as the technology advances. The COVID-19 pandemic adds a degree \n",
      "of difficulty, since it is unclear how it may shift demand and consumer preferences in transport. For \n",

      "Pound for pound, gasoline is much more energy dense than today’s electric vehicle batteries. With \n",
      "today’s best battery technology, you need about 40 pounds of battery to store the same energy as one \n",
      "pound of gasoline, or 240 pounds of battery per gallon. 7This extreme difference in energy density might make electrifying any vehicle seem difficult, but electricity \n",
      "also has some factors working in its favor. Electric motors are a lot more efficient than internal combustion \n",
      "engines at transferring energy to the car’s wheels — they don’t waste nearly as much energy in the form \n",
      "of heat. Drivetrains in electric vehicles are also simpler and lighter, so some of the extra battery weight \n",
      "is offset by less weight in other parts of the car. For both of these reasons, you don’t need to carry as \n",
      "much energy in an electric vehicle to travel the same distance. For example, the 2020 Chevy Bolt has a \n",
      "259-mile range, but its battery only holds the equivalent of 1.8 gallons of gasoline in terms of energy.47 \n",
      "Factoring in efficiency and the lighter drivetrain, a passenger car needs about 50 pounds of battery \n",
      "today to provide the same travel range as a gallon of gasoline, or about nine pounds of battery per \n",
      "pound of gasoline. This differential in energy per unit of weight explains why battery powered airplanes \n",
      "or ships for all but short distances are not on the menu of options. Batteries are just not energy dense \n",
      "enough to do the job. Researchers are hard at work on lighter and less expensive batteries, but the \n",
      "level of improvement required will be too much for these long-distance forms of transportation in the \n",
      "foreseeable future. Deep decarbonization in these sectors will require a different solution.\n",
      "Gasoline carries much more energy per unit of weight than a battery. A gas-powered car with a 12.4-gallon tank carries 77.5 pounds of gasoline.\n",
      "A 77.5-pound battery, in contrast, would only carry an electric car 21 miles.\n",
