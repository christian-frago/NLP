      "For example, in Côte d’Ivoire, the participants \n",

      "prior to this study. Thus, when asking teachers to \n",

      "challenges faced in the assessment of 21st century \n",
      "skills. \n",
      " 1.   Test formats that are easy to score are used \n",
      "most frequently.  More than half of the tools \n",
      "provided were scored dichotomously (i.e., \n",
      "correct-incorrect). While common across many \n",
      "assessment programs due to the efficiency and \n",
      "objectivity of this type of scoring, dichotomous \n",
      "scoring limits the variety of responses that can \n",
      "be elicited and disregards a large amount of \n",
      "information. In particular, such formats restrict \n",
      "the capacity to assess levels of competency in \n",
      "the exercise of 21st century skills. This is a major \n",
      "challenge that has been discussed by the \n",
      "authors in an earlier publication (see Care, Kim \n",
      "et al., 2019).  2.   There is a lack of rubric development and \n",
      "use. The summary results show that where \n",
      "country-provided tools are designed to capture \n",
      "more detail, we most commonly find open \n",
      "format items that are scored using rating scales. \n",
      "Although rating scales can enable more than \n",
      "a correct-incorrect classification of student \n",
      "responses, subjectivity of ratings can impact \n",
      "the reliability of information. Depending on \n",
      "the nature of the rating scales, they may not \n",
      "guarantee substantial improvement over \n",
      "dichotomous scores. Where open-ended tools \n",
      "were collected, rubrics for the scoring of these \n",
      "were not made available – it is unclear whether \n",
      "these exist. For capture of complex cognitive \n",
      "and social processes well-defined rubrics are \n",

      " 3.   There is potential for many of the tools that \n",
      "were not originally designed to capture 21st \n",

      "1.  There are inadequacies in the understanding \n",
      "of definitions and nature of 21st century skills.  \n",
      "For example, in Côte d’Ivoire, the participants \n",
      "mentioned that there was no information on 21CS \n",
      "prior to this study. Thus, when asking teachers to \n",
      "provide classroom assessments that target skills, \n",
      "the researchers were faced with the challenge \n",

      "the knowledge necessary in this area and as a \n",
      "result, are unaware of how to teach and assess \n",
