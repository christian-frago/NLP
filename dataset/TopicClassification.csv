Learning Poverty rate in low- and middle-income countries was 53 percent—meaning that over 
half of all 10-year-old children couldn’t read and understand a simple age-appropriate story.2

had the worst access to schooling, highest dropout rates, and the largest learning deficits.3 All 
this means that the world was already far off track for meeting the Sustainable Development 
Goal, which commits all nations to ensure that, among other ambitious targets, “all girls and 
boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education.”",14.527866,4.71313,0.886199,1.389419,3.831437,2.040501,2.924299,1.489059,1.458608,6.459892,1.425601,1.52683,0.634613,3.113626,1.681478,17.997022,1.029107,6.681745,1.459177,0.529931,2.57334,4.207003,15.11107,0.784146,0.824816,0.700084,News,Executive-Summary.pdf
