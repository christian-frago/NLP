"Before the 
pandemic, 258 million children and youth of primary- and secondary-school age were out

"The 
Learning Poverty rate in low- and middle-income countries was 53 percent—meaning that over 
half of all 10-year-old children couldn’t read and understand a simple age-appropriate story.2 
Even worse, the crisis was not equally distributed:  the most disadvantaged children and youth 
had the worst access to schooling, highest dropout rates, and the largest learning deficits.3 All 
this means that the world was already far off track for meeting the Sustainable Development 
Goal, which commits all nations to ensure that, among other ambitious targets, “all girls and 
boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education.”",1.500578,33.431423,3.514151,3.818671,6.178892,9.820977,1.695679,7.743069,8.274218,4.482249,1.038965,6.818265,1.254173,5.218881,2.820724,2.389086,Best Selling Books,Executive-Summary.pdf

increased  compared to 1990 levels.25
In middle-income and developing countries, lower 
ownership of personal vehicles and smaller distances 
traveled result in lower GHG emissions from 
transportation than in more developed economies, 
totaling 8.6% of total emissions in China26 and 12% 
in India.27 Still, global transportation emissions have 
more than doubled since 1970,28 and transport 
emissions are projected to continue to rise at faster 
rates in these countries than in the developed world,

their consumption is below the global average; rather, the country relies so much on

keep it this way.",2.434493,7.141758,1.416346,4.419647,6.733408,10.939627,2.031407,19.06573,7.296895,8.496192,1.423494,6.216942,10.283202,8.086628,0.994826,3.019407,Health Regimes,201030_Tsafos_Carey_Energy_Transition_Strategies_Ethiopia_Low_Carbon_Development_Pathway.pdf

topography results in high climate variability that is only likely to increase.10 In 2016, a 
severe drought reduced livestock and agricultural output, contributing to malnutrition

1980s, five of which have resulted in famines and all have had major economic impacts—
lowering GDP by between 1 and 4 percent each time.12 These changes will not just 
affect agriculture but also Ethiopia’s infrastructure, with 80 percent of roads unpaved 
and easily degraded by heavy rains and floods; its reliance on hydroelectricity is also 
expected to increase
